        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>My first gaming console was a PS3 that my parents got for me to play at their shop while they worked. It became something I would do every day, making friends and playing online games. As I continued to grow up playing games, it made me more interested in technology. I learned how to build computers and how each of the components worked separately and together.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>
        <p>Sports were a big part of my life growing up. My family loved soccer and wanted me to play, but I didn't want to. I wanted to play American football. So, my parents signed me up at a young age, and I played throughout high school.</p>
